      <t>
	The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide
	origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data
	by using digital signatures.  These digital signatures can be
	verified by building a chain-of-trust starting from a trust
	anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS.
	This document specifies two different ways for validating
	resolvers to signal to a server which keys are referenced in
	their chain-of-trust (see <xref target="Evolution"/>
	for the rationale).  The data from such signaling allow zone administrators
	to monitor the progress of rollovers in a DNSSEC-signed zone.
      </t>

    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033"/>,
	<xref target="RFC4034"/> and <xref target="RFC4035"/> were developed
	to provide origin
	authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital
	signatures.  DNSSEC uses Key Tags to efficiently match signatures to
	the keys from which they are generated.  The Key Tag is a 16-bit
	value computed from the RDATA portion of a DNSKEY RR using a formula
	not unlike a ones-complement checksum.  RRSIG RRs contain a Key Tag
	field whose value is equal to the Key Tag of the DNSKEY RR that validates
	the signature.
      </t>
      <t>
	Likewise, Delegation Signer (DS) RRs also contain a Key Tag field whose
	value is equal to the Key Tag of the DNSKEY RR to which it refers.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document specifies how validating
	resolvers can tell a server, in a DNS query, which DNSSEC key(s) they
	would use to validate the server's responses.
	It describes two independent methods for conveying Key Tag information
	bewteen clients and servers:
    placing an EDNS option in the OPT meta-RR <xref target="RFC6891"/>
    that contains the key tags (described in <xref target="option-all"/>),
    and by periodically sending special "key tag queries"
	to a server authoritative for the zone (described in <xref target="query-all"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
	Each of these new signaling mechanisms is OPTIONAL to implement and use.
	These mechanisms serve to measure the
	acceptance and use of new DNSSEC trust anchors and key signing keys (KSKs).
	This signaling data can be used by zone administrators as a gauge
	to measure the successful deployment of new keys.  This is of particular
	interest for the DNS root zone in the event of key and/or algorithm rollovers that
	rely on <xref target="RFC5011"/> to automatically update a validating DNS resolver's
	trust anchor.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document does not introduce new processes for rolling keys or updating
	trust anchors.
	Rather, it specifies a means by which a DNS
	query can signal the set of keys that a client uses for DNSSEC validation.
      </t>

    <section anchor="Evolution" title="Design Evolution">
      <t>
	Initially, when the work on this document started, it
	proposed including Key Tag values in a new EDNS(0) option
	code.  It was modeled after <xref target="RFC6975"/>, which
	provides DNSSEC algorithm signaling.
      </t>
      <t>
	The authors received feedback from dnsop Working Group participants
	that it might be better to convey Key Tags in QNAME of a
	separate DNS query, rather than as an EDNS(0) option.  Mostly
	this is because forwarding (e.g. from stub to recursive to
	authoritative) could be problematic.  Reasons include:
	<list style="numbers">
	  <t>
	    EDNS(0) is a hop-by-hop protocol.  Unknown option codes
	    would not be forwarded by default, as per <xref
	    target="RFC6891"/>.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Middleboxes might block entire queries containing unknown
	    EDNS(0) option codes.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    A recursive might need to remember Key Tag values (i.e.,
	    keep state) received from its stub clients and then
	    forward them at a later opportunity.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	One advantage of the EDNS(0) option code is that it is
	possible to see that a stub client has a different Key Tag
	list than its forwarder.  In the QNAME-based approach,
	this is not possible because queries originated by a stub
	and a forwarder are indistinguishable.  The authors feel
	this advantage is not sufficient to justify the EDNS(0)
	approach.
      </t>
      <t>
	One downside to the QNAME approach is that it uses a separate
	query, whereas with EDNS(0) the Key Tag values are
	"piggy-backed" on to an existing DNSKEY query.  For this
	reason, this document recommends only sending QNAME-based key tag queries
	for configured trust anchors, although EDNS-based key tags can be
	sent with any DNSKEY query.
      </t>
      <t>
	Another downside to the QNAME-based approach is that since the trust
	anchor zone might not contain labels matching the QNAME, these queries
	could be subject to aggressive negative caching features
	now in development by the Working Group.  This could affect
	the amount of signaling sent by some clients compared to
	others.
      </t>
      <t>
	A probably minor downside to the QNAME-based approach is that it cannot
	be used with extremely long query names if the addition of the prefix
	would cause the name to be longer than 255 octets.

 I wonder whether it might be useful for a responder to signal its
 capability of understanding the option, either by including this
 option in the response or in some other way.  Then the resolver may
 use that information to suppress further unnecessary generation and
 inclusion of the key-tag option.  Not a strong opinion, but raising
 it just in case it's worth considering.

Duane:
I generally like bi-directional signaling such as this, so I would not
oppose having the server indicate its support for the feature in a response.

I would like to hear from implementors whether or not they feel this places
a burden on the implementation.  I know they already must do things like
retry queries with/without EDNS and sometimes find a UDP message size that
works.  This adds to those state-keeping requirements.

Do we have to worry about middleboxes that would allow the option code in
queries but block it in responses?

We also would have to figure out whether a recursive should signal its
support of the feature to a stub.
-->
      <t>
	The KEY-TAG value(s) included in the edns-key-tag option represent the
	Key Tag of the Trust Anchor or DNSKEY RR that will be used to validate the expected response.
	When the client sends a DNSKEY query, the edns-key-tag option represents
	the Key Tag(s) of the KSK(s) of the zone for which the server is authoritative.
	A validating resolver learns the Key Tag(s) of the KSK(s) from the zone's
	DS record(s) (found in the parent), or from a configured trust anchor.
      </t>
      <t>
	A DNS client SHOULD include the edns-key-tag option when issuing a DNSKEY
	query for a zone corresponding to a configured Trust Anchor.
      </t>
      <t>
	A DNS client MAY include the edns-key-tag option when issuing
	a DNSKEY query for a non-Trust Anchor zone (i.e., Key Tags
	learned via DS records).  Since some DNSSEC validators
	implement bottom-up validation, non-Trust Anchor Key Tags
	zone might not be known at the time of the query.  Such a
	validator can include the edns-key-tag option based on
	previously cached data.
      </t>
      <t>
	A DNS client MUST NOT include Key Tag(s) for keys which are
	not learned via either configured Trust Anchor or DS records.
      </t>
      <t>
	Since the edns-key-tag option is only set in the query, if
	a client sees these options in the response, no action needs to be
	taken and the client MUST ignore the option values.
      </t>

      <section title="Stub Resolvers">
        <t>
	  Typically, stub resolvers rely on an upstream recursive server (or
	  cache) to provide a response.  Optimal setting of the edns-key-tag
	  option depends on whether the stub resolver elects to
	  perform its own validation.
	</t>
	<section title="Validating Stub Resolvers">
	  <t>
	    A validating stub resolver sets the DNSSEC OK (DO) bit <xref target="RFC4034"/> to
	    indicate that it wishes to receive additional DNSSEC RRs (i.e., RRSIG
	    RRs) in the response.  Such validating resolvers SHOULD include the
	    edns-key-tag option in the OPT RR when sending a DNSKEY

	    A validating recursive resolver is, by definition, configured
	    with at least one trust anchor.  Thus, a recursive resolver
	    SHOULD include the edns-key-tag option in its DNSKEY queries
	    as described above.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    In addition, the clients of a validating recursive
	    resolver might be configured to do their own validation,
	    with their own trust anchor(s).  When a validating
	    recursive resolver receives a query that includes the
	    edns-key-tag option with a Key Tag list that differs
	    from its own, it SHOULD forward both the client's Key
	    Tag list as well as its own.  When doing so, the recursive
	    resolver SHOULD transmit the two Key Tag lists using
	    separate instances of the edns-key-tag option code in
	    the OPT meta-RR.
	    For example, if the recursive resolver's Key Tag list
	    is (19036, 12345) and the stub/client's list is (19036,
	    34567), the recursive would include the edns-key-tag option
	    twice: Once with values (19036, 12345) and once with
	    values (19036, 34567).
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    A validating recursive resolver MAY combine stub/client Key Tag values

	    Key Tags to include in the outgoing edns-key-tag option.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    If the client included the DO and Checking Disabled (CD) bits, but
	    did not include the edns-key-tag option in the query, the

	    Key Tag values in full.

	A key tag query consists of a standard DNS query of type NULL
        and of class IN <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	The first component of the query name is the string "_ta-" followed
	by a sorted, hyphen-separated list of hexadecimal-encoded Key Tag values.
	The zone name corresponding to the trust anchor is appended to this
	first component.
      </t>
      <t>
	For example, a validating DNS resolver that has a single root

	a query of the form QTYPE=NULL, QCLASS=IN, QNAME=_ta-4444.

	Hexadecimal values MUST be zero-padded.  For example, if the

      <t>
	When representing multiple key tag values, they MUST be sorted

	An authoritative name server receiving key tag queries

	Tag values to provide information to the zone operator.
      </t>
      <t>
	An authoritative name server MUST generate an appropriate
	response to the key tag query.  
	A server does not need to have built-in logic
	that determines the response to key tag queries: the response code
	is determined by whether the data is in the zone file or
	covered by wildcard. The zone operator might want
	to add specific key tag records to its zone, perhaps with specific TTLs,
	to affect the frequency of key tag queries from clients.

      <section title="Interaction With Aggressive Negative Caching">
        <t>
	  Aggressive NSEC/NSEC3 negative caching
	  <xref target="draft-ietf-dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse"/> may also affect the
	  quality of key tag signaling.  When the response code for a key
	  tag query is NXDOMAIN, DNS resolvers that implement aggressive
	  negative caching will send fewer key tag queries than resolvers
	  that do not implement it.
        </t>
	<t>
	  For this reason, zone operators might choose to create records
	  corresponding to expected key tag queries.  During a rollover
	  from key tag 1111 (hex) to key tag 2222 (hex), the zone could
	  include the following records:
      <figure>
	    <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
_ta-1111        IN   NULL   \# 0
_ta-2222        IN   NULL   \# 0
_ta-1111-2222   IN   NULL   \# 0
]]></artwork>
	  </figure>
	  Recall that when multiple key tags are present, the originating client
	  MUST sort them from smallest to largest in the query name.

   <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
      <t>
        This document specifies a way for a client to signal its trust anchor
        knowledge to a cache or server.  The
        goal of these optional mechanisms is to signal new trust anchor uptake in clients
        to allow zone administrators to know when it is possible to
        complete a key rollover in a DNSSEC-signed zone.
      </t>
      <t>
        There is a possibility that an eavesdropper or server could infer the
        validator in use by a client by the Key Tag list seen.
	This may allow an attacker to find validators using old, possibly broken, keys.
        It could also be used to identify the
        validator or narrow down the possible validator implementations in
        use by a client, which could have a known vulnerability that could be
        exploited by the attacker.
      </t>
      <t>
	Consumers of data collected from the mechanisms
	are advised that provided Key Tag values might be "made up"
	by some DNS clients with malicious or at least mischievous
	intentions.
	For example, an attacker with sufficient
	resources might try to generate large numbers of queries
	including only old Key Tag values, with the intention of
	delaying the completion of a key rollover.
      </t>
      <t>
	DNSSEC does not require keys in a zone to have unique Key
	Tags.  During a rollover there is a small possibility that
	an old key and a new key will have identical Key Tag values.
	Zone operators relying on the edns-key-tag mechanism SHOULD
	take care to ensure that new keys have unique Key Tag values.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations" anchor="privacy">
      <t>
	This proposal adds additional, optional "signaling" to DNS queries
	in the form of Key Tag values.  While Key Tag values
	themselves are not considered private information, it may
	be possible for an eavesdropper to use Key Tag values as a
	fingerprinting technique to identify particular DNS validating
	clients.  This may be especially true if the validator is
	configured with trust anchor for zones in addition to the
	root zone.
      </t>
      <t>
	A validating resolver need not transmit the
	key tags in every applicable query.  Due to
	privacy concerns, such a resolver MAY choose to transmit
	the key tags for a subset of queries (e.g., every
	25th time), or by random chance with a certain probability
	(e.g., 5%).
      </t>
      <t>
	Implementations of this specification MAY be administratively
	configured to only transmit the key tags for
	certain zones.  For example, the software's configuration
	file may specify a list of zones for which use of the mechanisms described here
	is allowed or denied.  Since the primary motivation for
	this specification is to provide operational measurement
	data for root zone key rollovers, it is RECOMMENDED that
	implementations at least include the edns-key-tag option
	for root zone DNSKEY queries.
